## 🏴 Introduction
**Phishing** is a cybercrime where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data. These attacks often use emails, fake websites, or social engineering tactics to trick victims into providing their credentials.

## 🎭 Types of Phishing Attacks
- **Deceptive Phishing** – Fake emails/websites pretending to be from trusted sources.
- **Spear Phishing** – Targeted attacks customized for specific individuals or organizations.
- **Clone Phishing** – Replicates a legitimate message or website to deceive victims.
- **Whaling** – Targets high-profile individuals like executives or government officials.

## 🛑 Preventing Phishing Attacks
- **Enable Spam Filters** – Activate email spam filters to reduce malicious emails.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adds an extra security layer against unauthorized access.
- **Verify Senders & Links** – Double-check email addresses and avoid clicking unknown links.
